🗡️ Welcome to **Dungeon Adventures**, a project inspired by roguelike games. Roguelike is an exciting and challenging game genre in which players take on the role of a character exploring a procedurally generated dungeon.

🎯 The goal of the game is to reach the end of the dungeon while fighting off dangerous monsters and collecting treasure along the way, all while uncovering the truth about the main character. **Get ready for an epic adventure!**

🌟 The game consists of two levels where the hero must face a large number of monsters. By collecting items, the hero's abilities increase. After completing the labyrinth, the hero must face a boss. If he defeat the boss, he will be teleported to a room with crowns where he will be put to the test of wit and must find the crown that stands out.
